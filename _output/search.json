    "text": "The issue of rising economic inequality has been a hot topic for so long now that stating that fact has become a cliché in introductions. Larger monographs from wellknown authors has synthesized these findings and revealed insight into the state of affairs, as well as the trajectory that led to it, see Tomaskovic-Devey and Avent-Holt (2019), Savage (2021), and Piketty (2020). The general trend since the 1980s seems to be a larger concentration at the top of the income distribution, in every industrialized country.\n\n\nSavage, Mike. 2021. The Return of Inequality: Social Change and the Weight of the Past. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. https://doi.org/10.4159/9780674259652.\n\nPiketty, Thomas. 2020. Capital and Ideology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.\nThe focus of this article is intraorganizational power dynamics between individuals and groups, and their relation to wages. Intraorganizational used here here as the formal and informal relations between people working at the same geographical location, at the same worksite1. To make sense of the power dynamics, I will use the relational inequality theory (RIT), which states that besides productivity-related differences between people and companies, as in the human capital theory of Becker (1964), individuals create categorical distinctions and assign others to these categories. Through social interaction, meanings are ascribed to these categorical differences, allowing people in one category to seize and monopolize opportunities from those in another category. This exploitation occurs via a claims-making process in which individuals strive to secure and manage resources such as employment, salaries, and career advancements by forming discursive as well as juridical-legal justifications for their entitlement to them, based on ingroup-outgroup dynamics. See Tomaskovic-Devey and Avent-Holt (2019) for an overview.1 intraorganizational could also mean within companies, that can consist of several worksites, or other types of organizations entirely. This will not be the meaning of intraorganizational in this article, unless clearly stated.\nBecker, Gary S. 1964. Human Capital: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis, with Special Reference to Education. University of Chicago press.\n\nTomaskovic-Devey, Donald, and Dustin Avent-Holt. 2019. Relational Inequalities: An Organizational Approach. Oxford University Press. https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190624422.001.0001.\n\nThis article uses administrative linked employer-emplyee data (LEE) to assess the social networks of all the workssites in Denmark between 2010-2019. While this might not have the granularity of the meaning of the social relations - I cannot tell who are actually seeking advice from others, or which people are actually friends - that survey-based methods can have, the argument will be that the relations defined based on shared work history between employees is a signal of the network dynamics within an organization, that enables the statistical modelling of the effect of gendered networks on wages.\nOne such category is the gender. While physical differences might possibly account for some differences, the social categorization of gender has certainly been a prime example of types of non-meritocratic inequality processes that RIT seek to explain.\nWhile the RIT framework has produced articles of sophisticated statistical identification of such categorical effects, on gender and ethnicity, the proxies for group dynamics has been focused on different aggregate proxies for group power dynamics, such as the relative size of the different groups within the worksite, at different levels of hierarchy, e.g. the share of women at the workplace, and/or the share or women in management at the workplace, or the amount of inequality within the worksite.\nIt seems to me that the RIT framework has an untapped potential empirically. As I read the theory, it tries to bridge the gap between quantitative and qualitative methods by using the advances in data available - such as linked employer-emplyee (LEE) data - and advances in stastical modelling techniques, such as random effects coefficients for each workplace - and thereby showing how econometric methods is able to explain variance at the level of analysis where people actually take part in economic activity - the worksite, instead of aggregating beyond it2. This has traditionally been the domain of qualitative analysis, that stresses the particular social relations that sum up into, for example, a toxic masculine workplace culture, and that might be less pronounced - or even reversed - at another worksite. RIT seeks to move quantitative, large-N studies closer to this level of analysis, so as to show the general patterns in local power dynamics3.2 One might say the discussion between Grusky and Weeden (2001) and Goldthorpe (2002) was a prerunner for this.\nGrusky, David B., and Kim A. Weeden. 2001. “Decomposition Without Death: A Research Agenda for a New Class Analysis.” Acta Sociologica (Taylor & Francis Ltd) 44 (3): 203–18. http://search.ebscohost.com.ep.fjernadgang.kb.dk/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=5513078&site=ehost-live.\n\nGoldthorpe, John H. 2002. “Occupational Sociology, Yes: Class Analysis, No: Comment on Grusky and Weeden’s \"Research Agenda\".” Acta Sociologica 45 (3): 211–17. http://www.jstor.org/stable/4194931.\n3 This is not to say that macro-level factors such as institutional settings and market features are not powerful components, too. See Avent-Holt and Tomaskovic-Devey (2010) for a discussion.\nAvent-Holt, Dustin, and Donald Tomaskovic-Devey. 2010. “The Relational Basis of Inequality: Generic and Contingent Wage Distribution Processes.” Work and Occupations 37 (2): 162–93. https://doi.org/10.1177/0730888410365838.\n\nWhile the methods used in RIT are focued on this local level, and uses qualitative studies to legitimate this focus by showing how local social relations are important, the operationalization has previously been measures of, for example, number of women at the worksite, or the share of women in management, combined with other aggregates at the worksite level. This has yielded exciting results that sheds light on the dynamics of economic inequality. But it might be possbile to get even closer to the power dynamics that RIT theorizes and qualitive studies excel in, by using social network analysis, a well-established method and field in itself.\nSome attempts at getting deeper into the social relations has been made. In these study of Abendroth (2016) they use the dyadic gender-composition of workers and managers, e.g. the effect on wages when a male manager is the supervisor of a male worker, vis-a-vis a male manager managing a female worker and so on, to examine the effect on blah blah\nWhile this results show interesting effects, it is the aim of this article to go beyond these dyadic relationships and try to understand the social relations in network terms beyond the dyad, in terms of transitivity, betweeenness and so on. While there exists good research on this, they are typically confined to a single or a few worksites.\nAn example might be usefull. in Krackhardt (2003), the authors examine a small IT company, with 36 employees. Constructing the network within the firm4 out of a questionnaire asking all employees about who their friends in the company are (social/emotional support) and who they seek advice from (task support). A few months after the data collection, the company faced a difficult situation, as The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) informed firm management that they were granting a petition by a national union to hold a certification election. This did not thrill management, and the following months, a powerstruggle followed among the employees, who were not all convinced that this was in their interest. The labour union failed in achieving certification. They lost the popular vote, although they did at have a substantial support among the employees. So what happened?4 Here ‘worksite’ and ‘firm’ is synonymous\nKrackhardt et al. interviewed 6 key employees after the election, and argue that the betweenness score in the friendship network structure was a key component in the lost petition. The most vocal pro-union employee - who was also officially supported by the union - had a low betweenness score in the friendship network. The two anti-union employees were a lot more central.\nIn this way, the network structure accurately portray the bargaining process and the outcome, all of which has surely affected wages and other benefits in the firm. Krackhardt et al. points out that the most central employee in the friendship network was supportive, albeit hesitantly, of the unionization, but was also friends with the two vocal anti-union employees, so he choose to keep out of the discussion and the end even abstained from voting on the issue. Had the union appproach him, things migt have gone differently.\nIt is the goal of this article to examine how these network measures might add to the explanatory power of RIT. One might say that it is the goal of the article to get RIT closer to the local dynamics, and in the same turn get SNA closer to large-scale analysis, since these, because of data limitations, have often been confined to single or few case studies5.5  for a noticeable exception, see Jacobs (2021), who find that there is no effect when regressing network measurements on firm performance. this is a large-scale study based on e-mail networks. 1.8 billion messages sent by 1.4 million users from 65 US firms, and the result is perplexing, to say the least. This article might contribute to this discussion\nJacobs, Duncan J., Abigail Z. And Watts. 2021. “A Large-Scale Comparative Study of Informal Social Networks in Firms.” Management Science Series A-Theory 67 (9): 5489–509. https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.3997.\n\nOf course, the level of closeness to the social relations poised by Krackhardt (2003) is not possible with administrative data. Even the Danish State does not keep a population-level record of friendship among its citizens, after all. As is wellknown, network analysis is very sensitive to measurement error Laumann, Marsden, and Prensky (1983), and so the networks posed cannot be conceptualized as complete - this means that the network metrics posed in this article are not ‘realistic’ in the sense that someone with a highest level of betweenness, say, is the actual most central person. Since social relations at work - or any other place for that matter - is multidimensional, and depends upon what any given relation is used for - former research such as Mcguire (2015) points to three dimensions of social utility at work:\n\nKrackhardt, N And Eccles, David And Nohria. 2003. “The Strength of Strong Ties.” Networks in the Knowledge Economy 82.\n\nLaumann, Edward, Peter V. Marsden, and David Prensky. 1983. “The Boundary Specification Problem in Network Analysis.” In Applied Network Analysis: A Methodological Introduction, edited by Ronald S. Burt and Michael J. Minor, 18–34. Sage.\n\nMcguire, William T., Gail M. And Bielby. 2015. “The Variable Effects of Tie Strength and Social Resources: How Type of Support Matters.” Work and Occupations 43 (1): 38–74. https://doi.org/10.1177/0730888415596560.\n\ninfluence-conferring support (support that enhances an employee’s influence at work),\ntask support (assistance with everyday job tasks)\nsocial support (emotional aid).\n\nIt is unlikely that ex-collegial ties capture these aspects anywhere near the complexity they contain. and, as such, they are incomplete measures, that will be susceptible to measurement errors.\nRather, the networks posed here, defined as the social relations (possibly) established through a shared history of working at the same places in the past. One might say they are like the ‘shadow’, or the footprint, of the actual relations of the workplace. They are a signal of the social relations, that, though noisy, might still be a ‘a level deeper’ than most other measures that can be achieved at scale.\nthus, they might shed light on the dynamics of employee bargaining power when estimating the effect of the social relations within the worksite, on the wages. When combined with the categorical distinctions involved in these networks, though incomplete, the structural features of the network properties studied have a validity about general tendencies in network structure at the local level. This should make up for the for the lack in granularity - and quite possibly missing links - of the particular network at each worksite.\n\n\n2 Previous research on gender inequality at the worksite level\nThe following will focus mostly on the RIT litterature. For an overview in general, see Tolbert (2016).\n\nTolbert, Emilio J., Pamela S. And Castilla. 2016. “Editorial Essay: Introduction to a Special Issue on Inequality in the Workplace (‘What Works?’).” Industrial and Labor Relations Review 70 (1): 3–15. https://doi.org/10.1177/0019793916675336.\nWhile Tomaskovic-devey (2015) is about ethcniticy rather than gender, the approach to estimating worksite-level effects is foundational for the approach used in this article. Tomaskovic-devey (2015) looks at wage differences between native Swedish workers and non-western Swedish with immigrant background.\nThey fit a fixed effects model with strong individual controls for human capital characteristics, and finds substantial evidence of worklevel (non-meritocratic) characteristics affecting the wage gap, such as: The share of NW immigrants at the workplace. The share of no. This supports the claim that important inequality-generating mechanisms are in fact happening at the worksite, also in a highly regulated labour markets such as the those in Scandinavia.\nAbendroth (2016) use LEE data from german companies with &gt; 500 employees, in order to understand how gendered access to power is related to gender differences in wages. They use manager–worker dyads as indicators of power in the workplace, as well indicators of HR practices regarding hiring transparency. Their findings suggest, in line with previous research [indsaet her fra artikel], that the share of women in management does shorten[?] the gender wage gap. The more relational indicators the gendered access to power is that of manager-worker dyads, while also dividing the sample into into high skilled and low skilled workers6. The general trend is that having a women manager is associated with a wage penalty, and that this effect is largest for women workers in high skilled jobs.6 and approach also used in Tomaskovic-devey (2015)\nTomaskovic-devey, Martin And Avent-holt, Donald And Hällsten. 2015. “Where Do Immigrants Fare Worse?

Let\nthe model is specified as follows:\n\\[ \\hat{log(wage)}_{iwt} = {\\delta}_{o} + {\\delta Female}_{i} + {\\delta X }_{wt} + {\\delta X }_{it} +  {\\varphi}_{w(i,t)} + {\\varphi}_{t} + {\\epsilon}_{ijt} \\]\nWhere \\({\\delta Female}_{i}\\) is an binary index for gender, \\({\\delta X }_{wt}\\) is a vector of time-varying workplace controls, \\({\\delta X }_{it}\\) is a vector of time-varying individual controls. \\({\\varphi}_{w(i,t)}\\) is a fixed effect for the worksite-ISCO-year combination and \\({\\epsilon}_{ijt}\\) is the error term."

    "text": "1.1 About the registries, continued\nThe data comes from the Statistics Denmark, and is primarily based on the Workforce Registry (RAS), the Wage-worksite registry (IDAN) and the General Population registry (BEF).\nI only take into account full-time jobs recognized by Statistics Denmark as a worker’s primary employment source for the year when RAS is tallied each November (referred to as November jobs).\nThis definition will favour the analysis towards workers with a stable connection to the labour market. While including people with a marginal attachment to the labour market is possible, it would introduce several new sources of error, would add to the already complex data structure and take a lot of time. Therefore, I choose to focus on the stable labour market which does after all include most people [find ref or make some numbers from DST yourself]\nBy using November jobs, I exclude job moves made while workers maintain another, more significant job, and instances where a job mover has already left their new job by November.\nTo make sure that two people actually worked together at the same time, there need to be more than a year of overlap at the same worksite in the registry: it is not enough that person A stopped working at worksite X in 2018 and person B began working there in 2018, since person A could have left the worksite in September and person B could have started in November or in December. Of course, since we know it was their primary source of employment, the chance that person Bs primary source of employement should have happened only the last two months of that year is small. But it will happen, and in order to remove these spurious ties, for person A and B to have a tie person A would have to stop working there in 2019 and not in 2018 (assuming person B started in 2018)33 The analysis has been repeated for the years XXX to YYY that contains start and end dates for all jobs. The differences were negligible. #todo\nI exclude the military from the analysis, and everyone with a missing ISCO code [ how many? #todo ]"
