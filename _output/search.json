    "text": "README (IOA summergames ’23)\nThis is an unfinished draft, and the analysis part has only the results of the (fixed effects) regression models and not much in the way of explanation, the same with the descriptive figures. They make more sense if you work with that sort of thing normally, but even then, they might be hard to interpret without explanations. I am currently at a summerschool taking a course that is quite hard, and I do not have the time to make a better draft for you than this, sorry.\nThe part of the article that is in the most finished state is the part called Outline (p. 1-18). If you have the time, you can also look at the chapter descriptive statistics (p. 19-24) and Analysis, which is basically just one page with the results of the first regression analysis, in an coefficient plot. Looking at that plot might be a good idea, although, as there is no explanation, I will explain it at the Summer Games session.\nIn the PDF version of this article, the figures have very small text. I have not corrected this yet. If you have the time and the inclination, you can see the html version here, where the figures are clickable, and can be enlarged to fullscreen by doing so.\nThe article is rendered using quarto."

    "text": "1.3 The combined simple model\n\n\n\ntest\nfuck model ja In this model, both coworker and manager ties are included. I have opted for a fully saturated dummy-version with all combinations of of ego-gender and alter-tie types instead of interaction effects, as it eases the interpretation of the coefficients.\nThe coefficients are ordered according to the hypothesis about the benefits - e.g. wage-gains - associated with each category. A rough overview of the estimates confirms this, with a female employee with no contacts being the most disadvantageous, and a man with manager and coworker ties being the most advantageous, at least within occupation. There are important nuances to this, which tells us something about the relational power structures at work here.\nThe first point is that a women with coworker ties with-occ-fe has a slightly negative, but roughly similar, wage as a the reference categoy of being a man with no ties.\nThe second, and somewhat surprising, point is that a there is no difference between a woman with no ties and a woman with manager ties, with fixed effects on occupation, while there is a difference roughly similar to having a coworker tie, when not accounting for occupation. This tells us that the mechanism of having a manager tie is working directly through occupations, and is virtually indistinguishable from occupational relational power. [#spm-til-lasse: er stadig usikker paa de her tolkninger.]\nThe third point is that a woman with both coworker and manager ties is roughly equal to a man without ties when not controlling for occupation, and have a small advantage when taking occupation into account.\nIn stark contrast to this, having a coworker tie within the occupation almost nullifies the wage difference, while it does not matter at all for the gender wage gap at the worksite as such, e.g. with no controls on occupation.\nThe fourth point is that for a man with 1 tie, within occupation it makes no difference if that tie is a coworker tie or a manager tie. However when looking at the worksite at large, then having a manager tie is a lot more valuable than a coworker tie - so much so, in fact, that it is the most potent coefficient in the model (13.9 %)\nThe model\n\n\n\nlabel fuck here"
