# Team moves

A team move is defined as a situation where *n* people (n > 1) move together from worksite A to worksite B in the following year. 


Team moves needs to be inferred by patterns of movement between worksites, and the companies that the worksites are nested within. There is a difference in team moves between two worksites *within* the same company, and team moves between two worksites that are not within the same company. 

One challenge is to separate the sort of team moves that happens by circumstance, and the ones that are made by choice. Without directly asking the individuals, we cannot actually know wether a move made by two persons from one work to another was a choice or happenstance. this will be key in my identification strategy. Also, the difference between these two types of moves - alike to the difference between homophily selection into companies and actual friendship-based connections - will not be randomly distruted across the labour market, but will correlate with the average size of workplaces within a sector - e.g. larger worksites in the sector or job type that a given worker has means more happenstance 'team'  moves, and visa versa.

These patterns are easier to establish by empirical example. The following will use the year 2017 (= "T0") and 2018 (= "T1") to establish the mobility patterns. These observations can best be conceptualized as *dyads*, a relationship in the terms of worker mobility, between worksite A and worksite B - information from both years are utilized to create the dyadic observation between any two worksites from which a move was conducted.



## Defining the population


First, we exclude the \~ 32.000 persons within each year that does either has an cvrnr but does not have an arbnr (\~ 30.000), or that has an arbnr but does not have an cvrnr (\~ 2.000). This is less than xxx of the working population, as these are not part of the collegaial edgelists anyway, since they require both, see appendix xxx.
 
After removing these, we have \~ 2.900.000 people with a job, in \~ 290.000 companies, across \~ 330.000 worksites. These numbers do not vary substantially across the two years. 

\~ 2.630.000 had a job in both years. Of these, \~ 575.000 people changed from worksite to another worksite. \~ 130.000  of these moves between worksites was within the same company identifier, and can therefore be characterized as a move within an internal labour market within the company. \~ 450.000 did not move within the same company, and are therefore moves on the external labour markets^[ignoring, for now, the possibility of a merger-or-acquisition-type 'jobmove'.].

Within the internal labour markets, \~ 90.000 people moved from one worksite to another *with another worker from the same worksite*, which amounts to \~ 70 pct of the moves on the internal markets. On the external markets, 75.000 workers moved together, which is \~ 15 pct of the moves on the external markets. 

That the number of people moving together from one worksite to another is higher - even a lot higher - than on the external markets is to be expected. 


[the numbers have been rounded with large margins, and therefore do not add up. The order of magnitudes is the important information here.]{.aside}

The ~ 575.000 people who change jobs are the object of this analysis, and instead of looking at it in absolute numbers they can be separated into individual moves and team moves, and the conditional distributions can then be the subject of analysis. 


## Conditional distributions


The 165.000 team moves makes up 28 % of the total number of jobmoves. in @tbl-team-moves-lmarket-nace, we see that 44 % of these team moves are jobshifts to different firms, e.g. external labour markets. We also see that 91 % of the individual moves are happening on the external labour markets.^[
Some of the team moves might be falsely classified, since any two people moving to the same firm within the same year is considered to be moving 'together', which might be a coincidence.  This means that the number of team moves to external labour markets has an upward bias. This could be decreased by saying team moves are > 2 persons and/or using dates and having a three months window, for example.]

The share of team moves to a different sector in the economy ^[
Defined in terms of the Danish Industry codes at the most agggregated level]
is at 20 % about half of the moves happening for individual moves. Which is perhaps not surprising, given that most firms operate within the same sector, and more than half of the team moves happen within the same company.

```

in @tbl-team-moves-app-disapp, the combination of different types of worksite and firm closures and openings are used to establish a typology of move types.  First a definition of worksites and firms will be helpful. 


| name  | definition | 
|---------|:-----|
| worksite A      | the worksite a worker is moving from   |
| worksite B     |  the worksite a worker is moving to  | 
| firm X       |  the firm a worker is moving from   | 
| firm Y       |  the firm a worker is moving to   | 

: Definition of types

The combination of these types are ordered by frequency, and the ones with < 3 pct within the labour market type are not shown for clarity. 



The most common type is that the worksite A is not closed in the same year as the worker leaves the worksite, and that worksite B does not appear in the year after, e.g. the year the worker moves to that worksite - and that this also applies to the firms X and Z.  This is by far the most frequent type, and what's most interesting about that is that both the external labour market and the internal labour market do not differ substantially from the generel trend where ~ 80 % of the individual moves are happening here and ~ 67 % of the team moves. It makes sense that a larger share of the moves people make in the same year - so far our minimalistic definition of a team move - will have something to do with firm or worksite closures and openings. It is interesting, however, that the difference on the internal and the external market is in terms of the *deviation* from this type, and not in terms of the share of this dominating type itself.

The rest of the types diverge alot in wether they function on the internal or the external market. The case where firms XY both existed, but worksite B appears is highly common on the internal market, for team moves especially with 16 %. On the external market, this type is less frequent, and never happens^[
the coarse rounding means that it might happen, but not on a scale that's interesting on a structural level.]
with individual moves.

```


the next thing is distribution of shares of team moves and individual moves within sectors. For reasons of clarity, I have excluded four sectors with < 5000 moves.^[ 
These are: 
**D:** *Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply*,
**E:** *Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities*,
**T:** *Activities of households as employers; undifferentiated goods- and services-producing activities of households for own use*,
**U:** *Activities of extraterritorial organizations and bodies*.
] 

A general trend is that when the share of team moves are high, then it is high in both the internal and external markets. The share of team moves the sectors of `F: Construction`, `K: Financial and insurance activities` and `N: Administrative and support service` are high in both market types. 

In the educational sector, the share is about average on the internal market, and very low on the external market. Considering most Danish educational institutions are public, it makes sense that you would see a different dynamic from the private sector.

as @granovetter1973strength says, it is the information inherent in the weak ties with information about jobs that are an important part of .... blah blah blah


In the first case, it's not actually a move. The identification of these cases serves as a crosswalk that can identify worksites that change only on the administrative level and can be considered to be one and the same. 





We can conceptualize 3 distinct types of team moves:

- Administrative change of the worksite identifier (e.g. a worksite is renamed). 
- Team moves 
- Mergers/acquisitions

In the following I will go the 3 types of team moves in more detail.


the actual date is not observed (make a test - you can, actually)







## Administrative change of the worksite identifier


The identification of these cases is made more complicated by the usual in- and outflow of workers at a worksite - the simple case of *all* workers moving to a new worksite is not very common, since in any given year, some workers are leaving the worksite to work at another worksite. This means that a threshold needs to be identified - above that threshold, if, say, 75 % of the workers seem to "move" from worksite A to worksite B, we can assume that it's the same worksite. Of course, at a small company, this might be more common just as a result of an actual team move - it's not unrealistic that 3 workers make an actual team move together, and if the company consists of 4 people, where the last might move to worksite C,  then workste A and B will erroneously classified as the same worksite. These two dimensions needs to be taken into account when making the decision rule. 

First, figure @fig-tmoves-histogram-pct_mover shows the distribution of worksite-to-worksite ties with the share of people that came from the 2017 worksite (that ceased to exit) , and are now working in the 2018 worksite (that only existed from that year). 


```{r new one, echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-tmoves-histogram-pct_mover
#| fig-cap: Distribution of worksites that appears for the first time in 2018, and the no. of people (in percent) in these worksites that came from another worksite, which ceased to exit in 2017. 
knitr::include_graphics('img/dst-shot/fig-tmoves-histogram-pct_mover.png')
```



```{r new one, echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-tmoves-hexagon-pct_moves-n_firm
#| fig-cap: Heatmap w. hexagonal bins, which plots the size of worksite A (2017) against the inflow out workers from worksite A to worksite B. The bins are colored by the no. of worksites in the bin. It can be seen that the mode of the distribution is very small N where every single worker moved to worksite B. These counts do not include worksites with a single person working in it. 
knitr::include_graphics('img/dst-shot/fig-tmoves-hexagon-pct_moves-n_firm.png')
```
 






In order to establish a sensible threshold that takes both the relative and the absolute size of the worksite into account, some descriptive statistics are needed.




## Team moves






## Mergers/acquisitions

not quite sure about this one - how to behave here?






the third case is a bit more complicated. It's a team move where the team moves together from worksite A to worksite B, but the worksite B is a new worksite that was created by merging two or more worksites. This is a bit more complicated because it's not clear how to count the team moves. For example, if worksite A and worksite B merge to create worksite C, and 10 people move from worksite A to worksite C, and 10 people move from worksite B to worksite C, should we count this as 20 team moves, or 10 team moves? I think the answer is 10 team moves, but I'm not sure.
