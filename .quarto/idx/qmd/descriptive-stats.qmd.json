As for the network boundary, this is current worksite. So any worksite will go from having everyone at he current worksite connected by having worked at a former worksite (a network of density=1) at the same time,  to having no one having worked together previously, (a network density of 0).  \n\nAs for the tie definition, only worksites w. <= 750 employees are considered. \n\n\nLarge establishments are excluded because the likelihood of two employees knowing each other in such places is low; however, this exclusion means that findings are only applicable to smaller firms.\nDenmark is a small-establishment economy, with ~ 90% of workers' primary employment in establishments of 750 workers or fewer in 2018. \n\n\nFurthermore, only current worksites with >= 10 employees are considered. The motivation for adding an extra exclusion restriction for very small current worksites, is that the power-and barganning dynamics will be different. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- \n## Trash\n\nThirdly, I exclude worksites within the public sector. The Danish and Scandinavian welfare states are characterized by a high degree of public sector employment, and the public sector is known to have a different social structure than the private sector [ find reference ]. \n\n\n\n I do *not*, however, exclude ties *formed* within the public sector, as there is no reason to believe that these should have a fundamentally different social value in the current worksite than ties formed in the private sector. -->\n\n\n# Descriptive stats \n\n\n\n## worksites and population \n\n\nThe baseline population is everyone who is 18 or older and who have a job and an associated worksite identifier, which includes most people [how many? return to this] . We use novprio jobs blah blah blah\n\n\nThe following table shows the amount of people working\n\n\n\nSince the population is defined only as worksites that has at least a single tie between two employees from a former worksite, looking at how these companies might differ from the general population of worksites of comparable sizes is of interest.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Selection into sample\n\nThe following is a table of t-tests where the two groups are the worksites with ties and the general population of worksites. The table shows the mean difference between the two groups, the mean in the population, the mean in the sample, and the p-value of the t-tests. \n\nThe categorical variables  - occupational groups and sector codes, both at the highest level - have been coded as dummies and the mean difference is the difference in the share of people in each category, within the population and the sample.\n\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\n\ntt1 = read_xlsx('input/desc/probabiliy-in-sample-ttest-net_arbnr.xlsx') |> data.table()\ntt2 = tt1[!is.na(p.value)][, !'grp']\ntt2[var == 'alder', var := 'Age']\ntt2[var == 'female', var := 'Female']\ntt2[var == 'heltid_32_kode', var := 'Full-time']\ntt2[var == 'n_arbnr', var := 'no. employees at worksite']\ntt2[, var := substr(var, 1, 20) ]\nsetnames(tt2, qc(var, mean_diff, mean1, mean2), c('', 'mean diff.',  'Mean in population', 'Mean in sample'))\n\n\n\n```\n\n\n```{r}\n\n\ntt2 %>% kable('html', booktabs=T) %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options=qc(striped), position='left', fixed_thead=T) |>  \nkable_paper('hover', full_width=TRUE)  |>\npack_rows('Ethnicity', 5, 7) |>\npack_rows('Occupation (1-digit ISCO)', 8, 16) |>\npack_rows('Sector (NACE)', 17, 35)\n# pack_rows( index = c(\"setosa\" = 2, \"versicolor\" = 4, \"virginica\" = 3))\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n\nWe see from the figure below that the worksites with ties are larger than the general population of worksites. This is to be expected, as: A) the general probability of a worksite to have a dyad of ex-collegues is higher and B) people working at larger worksites are plausably more likely to have worked at large worksites in the past, making ties more likely, and C) larger companies tend to be divided up to several workplaces, which are also larger, and a jump between within the company from one physical address to another is also a tie.\n\n[why is there a dip at the beginning of the dist for all worksites, which isn't there for the network ones? #TODO]\n\n![Sizes of worksites w. networks and worksites in general.
