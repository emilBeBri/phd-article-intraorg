There is a difference in team moves between two worksites *within* the same company, and team moves between two worksites that are not within the same company. \n\nOne challenge is to separate the sort of team moves that happens by circumstance, and the ones that are made by choice. Without directly asking the individuals, we cannot actually know wether a move made by two persons from one work to another was a choice or happenstance. this will be key in my identification strategy. Also, the difference between these two types of moves - alike to the difference between homophily selection into companies and actual friendship-based connections - will not be randomly distruted across the labour market, but will correlate with the average size of workplaces within a sector - e.g. larger worksites in the sector or job type that a given worker has means more happenstance 'team'  moves, and visa versa.\n<!-- indsaeet ref til afsnit om det naar du kommer til det. -->\n\n\nThese patterns are easier to establish by empirical example. The following will use the year 2017 (= \"T0\") and 2018 (= \"T1\") to establish the mobility patterns. These observations can best be conceptualized as *dyads*, a relationship in the terms of worker mobility, between worksite A and worksite B - information from both years are utilized to create the dyadic observation between any two worksites from which a move was conducted.\n\n\n\n## Defining the population\n\n\nFirst, we exclude the \\~ 32.000 persons within each year that does either has an cvrnr but does not have an arbnr (\\~ 30.000), or that has an arbnr but does not have an cvrnr (\\~ 2.000). This is less than xxx of the working population, as these are not part of the collegaial edgelists anyway, since they require both, see appendix xxx.\n \nAfter removing these, we have \\~ 2.900.000 people with a job, in \\~ 290.000 companies, across \\~ 330.000 worksites. These numbers do not vary substantially across the two years. \n\n\\~ 2.630.000 had a job in both years. Of these, \\~ 575.000 people changed from worksite to another worksite. \\~ 130.000  of these moves between worksites was within the same company identifier, and can therefore be characterized as a move within an internal labour market within the company. \\~ 450.000 did not move within the same company, and are therefore moves on the external labour markets^[ignoring, for now, the possibility of a merger-or-acquisition-type 'jobmove'.].\n\nWithin the internal labour markets, \\~ 90.000 people moved from one worksite to another *with another worker from the same worksite*, which amounts to \\~ 70 pct of the moves on the internal markets. On the external markets, 75.000 workers moved together, which is \\~ 15 pct of the moves on the external markets. \n\nThat the number of people moving together from one worksite to another is higher - even a lot higher - than on the external markets is to be expected. \n\n\n<!-- [the numbers have been rounded with large margins, and therefore do not add up. The order of magnitudes is the important information here.]{.aside} -->\n\nNote for the pdf version: there should be a flowchart here, but it is strangely formatted.

We also see that 91 % of the individual moves are happening on the external labour markets.^[\nSome of the team moves might be falsely classified, since any two people moving to the same firm within the same year is considered to be moving 'together', which might be a coincidence.  This means that the number of team moves to external labour markets has an upward bias. This could be decreased by saying team moves are > 2 persons and/or using dates and having a three months window, for example.]\n\nThe share of team moves to a different sector in the economy ^[\nDefined in terms of the Danish Industry codes at the most agggregated level]\nis at 20 % about half of the moves happening for individual moves. Which is perhaps not surprising, given that most firms operate within the same sector, and more than half of the team moves happen within the same company.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-team-moves-lmarket-nace .cell tbl-cap='why is this overlapping?? ffs'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped lightable-paper lightable-hover\" style=' font-family: \"Arial Narrow\", arial, helvetica, sans-serif; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;'>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;position: sticky; top:0; background-color: #FFFFFF;\"> type </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;position: sticky; top:0; background-color: #FFFFFF;\"> individual move </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;position: sticky; top:0; background-color: #FFFFFF;\"> team move </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr grouplength=\"1\"><td colspan=\"3\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid;\"><strong>Marginal share </strong></td></tr>\n<tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;padding-left: 2em;\" indentlevel=\"1\">  </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 72 % </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 28 % </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr grouplength=\"2\"><td colspan=\"3\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid;\"><strong>labour market type</strong></td></tr>\n<tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;padding-left: 2em;\" indentlevel=\"1\"> external market </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 91 % </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 44 % </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;padding-left: 2em;\" indentlevel=\"1\"> internal market </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 09 % </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 56 % </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr grouplength=\"2\"><td colspan=\"3\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid;\"><strong>changed sector</strong></td></tr>\n<tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;padding-left: 2em;\" indentlevel=\"1\"> different sector </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 55 % </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 20 % </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;padding-left: 2em;\" indentlevel=\"1\"> same sector </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 42 % </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 79 % </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr grouplength=\"2\"><td colspan=\"3\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid;\"><strong>Private/Public</strong></td></tr>\n<tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;padding-left: 2em;\" indentlevel=\"1\"> Public </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 26 % </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 41 % </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;padding-left: 2em;\" indentlevel=\"1\"> Private </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 74 % </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 59 % </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nin @tbl-team-moves-app-disapp, the combination of different types of worksite and firm closures and openings are used to establish a typology of move types.  First a definition of worksites and firms will be helpful. \n\n\n| name  | definition | \n|---------|:-----|\n| worksite A      | the worksite a worker is moving from   |\n| worksite B     |  the worksite a worker is moving to  | \n| firm X       |  the firm a worker is moving from   | \n| firm Y       |  the firm a worker is moving to   | \n\n: Definition of types\n\nThe combination of these types are ordered by frequency, and the ones with < 3 pct within the labour market type are not shown for clarity. \n\n\n\nThe most common type is that the worksite A is not closed in the same year as the worker leaves the worksite, and that worksite B does not appear in the year after, e.g. the year the worker moves to that worksite - and that this also applies to the firms X and Z.  This is by far the most frequent type, and what's most interesting about that is that both the external labour market and the internal labour market do not differ substantially from the generel trend where ~ 80 % of the individual moves are happening here and ~ 67 % of the team moves. It makes sense that a larger share of the moves people make in the same year - so far our minimalistic definition of a team move - will have something to do with firm or worksite closures and openings. It is interesting, however, that the difference on the internal and the external market is in terms of the *deviation* from this type, and not in terms of the share of this dominating type itself.\n\nThe rest of the types diverge alot in wether they function on the internal or the external market. The case where firms XY both existed, but worksite B appears is highly common on the internal market, for team moves especially with 16 %. On the external market, this type is less frequent, and never happens^[\nthe coarse rounding means that it might happen, but not on a scale that's interesting on a structural level.]\nwith individual moves. \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped lightable-paper lightable-hover\" style='width: auto !important;

For reasons of clarity, I have excluded four sectors with < 5000 moves.^[ \nThese are: \n**D:** *Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply*,\n**E:** *Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities*,\n**T:** *Activities of households as employers; undifferentiated goods- and services-producing activities of households for own use*,\n**U:** *Activities of extraterritorial organizations and bodies*.\n] \n\nA general trend is that when the share of team moves are high, then it is high in both the internal and external markets. The share of team moves the sectors of `F: Construction`, `K: Financial and insurance activities` and `N: Administrative and support service` are high in both market types. \n\nIn the educational sector, the share is about average on the internal market, and very low on the external market. Considering most Danish educational institutions are public, it makes sense that you would see a different dynamic from the private sector. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![share of team moves within each sector and labour market type.

The identification of these cases serves as a crosswalk that can identify worksites that change only on the administrative level and can be considered to be one and the same. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe can conceptualize 3 distinct types of team moves:\n\n- Administrative change of the worksite identifier (e.g. a worksite is renamed). \n- Team moves \n- Mergers/acquisitions\n\nIn the following I will go the 3 types of team moves in more detail.\n\n\nthe actual date is not observed (make a test - you can, actually)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Administrative change of the worksite identifier\n\n\nThe identification of these cases is made more complicated by the usual in- and outflow of workers at a worksite - the simple case of *all* workers moving to a new worksite is not very common, since in any given year, some workers are leaving the worksite to work at another worksite. This means that a threshold needs to be identified - above that threshold, if, say, 75 % of the workers seem to \"move\" from worksite A to worksite B, we can assume that it's the same worksite. Of course, at a small company, this might be more common just as a result of an actual team move - it's not unrealistic that 3 workers make an actual team move together, and if the company consists of 4 people, where the last might move to worksite C,  then workste A and B will erroneously classified as the same worksite. These two dimensions needs to be taken into account when making the decision rule. \n\nFirst, figure @fig-tmoves-histogram-pct_mover shows the distribution of worksite-to-worksite ties with the share of people that came from the 2017 worksite (that ceased to exit) , and are now working in the 2018 worksite (that only existed from that year). \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of worksites that appears for the first time in 2018, and the no. of people (in percent) in these worksites that came from another worksite, which ceased to exit in 2017.](img/dst-shot/fig-tmoves-histogram-pct_mover.png){#fig-tmoves-histogram-pct_mover width=874}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Heatmap w. hexagonal bins, which plots the size of worksite A (2017) against the inflow out workers from worksite A to worksite B.

It's a team move where the team moves together from worksite A to worksite B, but the worksite B is a new worksite that was created by merging two or more worksites. This is a bit more complicated because it's not clear how to count the team moves. For example, if worksite A and worksite B merge to create worksite C, and 10 people move from worksite A to worksite C, and 10 people move from worksite B to worksite C, should we count this as 20 team moves, or 10 team moves? I think the answer is 10 team moves, but I'm not sure.\n\n\n\n\n",
