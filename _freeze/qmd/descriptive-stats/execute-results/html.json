As for the network boundary, this is current worksite. So any worksite will go from having everyone at he current worksite connected by having worked at a former worksite (a network of density=1) at the same time,  to having no one having worked together previously, (a network density of 0).  \n\nAs for the tie definition, only worksites w. <= 750 employees are considered. \n\n\nLarge establishments are excluded because the likelihood of two employees knowing each other in such places is low; however, this exclusion means that findings are only applicable to smaller firms.\nDenmark is a small-establishment economy, with ~ 90% of workers' primary employment in establishments of 750 workers or fewer in 2018. \n\n\nFurthermore, only current worksites with >= 10 employees are considered. The motivation for adding an extra exclusion restriction for very small current worksites, is that the power-and barganning dynamics will be different. \n\n\n\n\nBy using November jobs, I exclude job moves made while workers maintain another, more significant job, and instances where a job mover has already left their new job by November^[The latter is problematic, and will lead to spurious ties in a small-ish number of cases. There exists an administrative registry with actual start/end-dates of jobs, from 2014 and onward. So a sensitivity analysis using this data will be part of the analysis.] \n\n\n\nTo make sure that two people actually worked together at the same time, there need to be more than a year of overlap at the same worksite in the registry: it is not enough that person A stopped working at worksite X in 2018 and person B began working there in 2018, since person A could have left in october and person B could have started in November or in December. Of course, since we know it was their primary source of employment, the chance that person Bs primary source of employement should have happened only the last two months of that year is small. But it will happen, and in order to remove these spurious ties, for person A and B to have a tie person A would have to stop working there in 2019 and not in 2018 (assuming person B started in 2018). \n\n\nI exclude the military from the analysis, and everyone with a missing ISCO code (how many? #todo)\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- \n## Trash\n\nThirdly, I exclude worksites within the public sector. The Danish and Scandinavian welfare states are characterized by a high degree of public sector employment, and the public sector is known to have a different social structure than the private sector [ find reference ]. \n\n\n\n I do *not*, however, exclude ties *formed* within the public sector, as there is no reason to believe that these should have a fundamentally different social value in the current worksite than ties formed in the private sector. -->\n\n\n# descriptive stats \n\n\n\n## \n\n\n\ninclude_graphics('img/dst-shot/fig-cherry489.png') \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/dst-shot/fig-cherry489.png){width=1138}\n:::\n:::\n\ntest here\n\n\n![entire labourforce: ~ 2.8 mio (29 relevant ) ](./img/dst-shot/fig-jalapeno89.png)\n\n\n\n\ndst-shot/fig-soybean88.png\n\n",
