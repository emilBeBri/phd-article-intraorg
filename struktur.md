# RIT 

- origins 
    + Relational Inequality Theory (RIT) has its origins in Tillys  is a theory seeking
    + Tilly’s Durable Inequality ð1998Þ is typically referred to as the modern genesis of RIT, but there is a strong inﬂuence in the earlier work of Frank Parkin ð1979Þ on social closure; Arne Kalleberg and colleagues ð1981Þ on
- something else
    - focus on the local processes of inequality, the outcome of which is typically measured in wages
    - the worksite as the focal point of human interaction in the production of value in society
    - recent advances in the availability of linked employer-employee (LEE) data makes econometric models with fixed effects feasible in order to get at the variation in wages at the worksite and the sources of these
    - The most basic prediction of RIT is that the matching of external status characteristics to jobs inﬂuences the relative power of both jobs and people ðTilly 1998Þ. 
        - this means that focus of RIT is the effect of categorical distintions such as gender and ethnicity and how these vary within the worksite 
    -
- in this article, the effect of these categorical distinctions will be measured in terms of wages, since this is a very tangible outcome of power relations - there is, however, no claim that this is the only or even the most relevant outcome, across all possible situations.
- the objective is translate the relational claims making mechanisms, synthesized into the RIT framework of inequality, and operationalize them into terms of social network analysis.
    - claims-making
    - exploitation

    + the effect of the gender composition of management on wages of workers. They use male-female dyads of the gender of the worker and the gender of the manager of any given worker, as well as dividing the workers into high- and lower qualified workers. Using crosssectional multilevel models, fixed effects on firms. They find that, although in general firms where a larger share of women occupy management positions decreases the wage gap, adding interaction effects for types of human ressource practices and dividing the sample into high- and lower qualified workers changes the effects considarbly, adding traction[?/weight] to the claim of company-specific practices are of considerable interest if one is to understand the dynamics of inequality and wage setting.

re

Lena Nekby (2003), for example, using  matched employer– employee data for Sweden finds that rising profits raise the wages of all  workers, but men receive about a 30% larger share of the rent. In addition, rent sharing is more  generous with high- wage workers, and it is here that she finds that women are most heavily  penalized. Thus, while resource flows influence income, workers with more powerful claims  on income—w hether derived from skills or positional or cultural resources—t end to benefit  the most. 




# The Danish institutional setting

- get union organization stats - from Tom, Lasse or Jonas
- development the last 30 years or something, rip off from somewhere



## ways that this works to predict exploitation / opportunity hoarding 

understanding the hypothesis from sweden  

Hypothesis 1
higher % of immigrants in workplace -> lower wage gap. BUT what if it's the immigrants that are larger % off? Different dynamic. 

reduced status penalty due to categorical distinction - beliefs about ability and so on. 

use a socioeconomic index of the residuals, so that any 



## social closure / opportunity hoarding


    At the individual level, status hierarchies, productivity, personal relationships with supervisors, human and social capital, and personality traits may enable successful claims. As well, social groups, such as unions, professional associations, departments, and spontaneously organized networks of employees, collectively approach employers to negotiate and make wage claims. Solidarity in intragroup networks, relative power over resources, capital ownership and control, and status hierarchies are likely to inﬂuence the persuasiveness of group-level claims making.


social closure (opportunity hoarding)
Opportunity hoarding is also referred to as social closure in much of this literature ðe.g., Weber ½19211968; Parkin 1979; Weeden 2002Þ.


Socially salient categorical distinctions are expected to be inﬂuential in
determining the frequency of explicit and implicit claims as well as their
legitimacy through mechanisms such as workplace speciﬁc symbolic capital
ðTatli and Özbilgin 2011Þ, othering ðSchwalbe et al. 2000Þ, status expectations ðRidgeway 1997Þ, stereotyping ðGorman 2005Þ, and cognitive biases in information processing ðNosek et al. 2007Þ. Low-status individuals
and groups will make fewer claims on resources, and their claims are less
likely to be ratiﬁed by powerful actors. This notion that actors create and
use categorical distinctions to pursue individual and collective social closure and ðreÞproduce inequality is widespread in social theory: in addition to Tilly ð1998Þ on categorical inequality, see Bourdieu ðBourdieu and
Wacquant 1992Þ on classiﬁcation struggles, Abbott ð2005Þ on jurisdictional
claims, and Lamont and Fournier ð1992Þ on cultural boundary work, but
this list is far from exhaustive.



When cultural categorical distinctions overlap with internal division of
labor, this magniﬁes the inequality that either alone would produce ðBlau
1977; Tilly 1998Þ. While inequalities are installed categorically, real actors/
jobs stand in relation to other actors/jobs in the organization and will inhabit multiple categorical distinctions simultaneously and in historically
speciﬁc interactional contexts ðCollins 1990; Glenn 2002Þ. Past research has
shown that when status distinctions such as authority and race ðor gender,
language group, education, job skill level, temporary employment statusÞ
overlap, they reinforce each other, increasing inequality between positions
ðHultin and Szulkin 1999, 2003; Avent-Holt and Tomaskovic-Devey 2010,
2012Þ.

## gamle spm
Hvordan kan man sige at @abendroth2016women laver noget der handler om worksites mere end andre modelleringsstrategier? Ja, saa siger de at dyads med managers er vigtigt, men hvis man ikke laver fixed effects modeller.. men selv hvis man goer det... ja, jeg forstaar det bare ikke, simpelthen. 

hvordan ved vi hvor meget varians der skyldes forskellige kilder? Hvordan laver man det maal? hvor skal jeg finde det? 

Hvordan skelne credential-baseret skills fra uddannelse som symbolic? DEt samme med occupation (naesten det samme i Danmark) - kan man overhovedet det? se @aventholt2010relational.  





# struktur fra gammel



- intro
- RIT perspective
  + organisations as the 'local inequality regime' 
    * just as important as occupations, institutions - but relative importance may vary 
  + claims-making, social closure and exploitation (exploitation er lidt tricky teoretisk men glem det lige nu)
  + *how* does firm-level characteristics matter? 
    * emperical examples
      - Australia-US variation managers core produktion-workers: variation around the median is important
      -   [@tomaskovicdevey2020rising] shows between workplace inequality rising - but within-workplace inequality also rising [@song2018firmingup] , due to composition of workers *claimsmaking?*. sna kan shed light on that.
    * this is not to say that institutional variation does not matter - back to australia/US example.
- tie in to social networks: Felds foci 
  + May be reformulated as foci
  + 


- comparative perspective in social network analysis. often associated with the formalist/durkheimian tradition (e.g. social structure as more important than subjective experience) 
  + [@jacobs2021largescale]
  + [@erikson2021networks]
  + [@collischon2021social]
  + [@faust2002comparing]
- a lot of single-firm studies in the relationalist tradition
  + hard to decipher the difference between general and specific tendencies
  + some stable patterns:
    * describe them 

- homophily / diversity /heterogenity 
  + formalist like [@blau1982heterogeneity]
  + in-between like [@mcpherson2001birds] [@skvoretz2013diversity]

- organizational demography shapes tie formation

- types of ties / tie identification
  + reagans 2009
  + weak and strong ties
  + respect, advice, support, career (eller hvad det nu var)
- decay of ties?

- gender in organizations
  + hypothesis: how does establishment demographic composition relates to network structure?
  +
